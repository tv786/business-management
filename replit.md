## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript ES6 modules with HTML5 and CSS3
- **PWA Implementation**: Service Worker for offline functionality, Web App Manifest for installability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with tablet and desktop breakpoints
- **Component Architecture**: Modular JavaScript classes for each business domain

### Backend Architecture
- **Firebase Integration**: Google Firebase for authentication and cloud storage
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach - localStorage for offline, Firestore for cloud sync
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with email/password and Google sign-in
- **Offline-First**: Complete functionality without internet connection
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time sync across devices when authenticated

## Key Components

### 2. Vendor Management (`js/vendors.js`)
- **Purpose**: Manage business vendors and suppliers
- **Features**: Add, edit, delete, search, filter, and sort vendors
- **Data Tracking**: Contact information, categories, status tracking

### 3. Transaction Management (`js/transactions.js`)
- **Purpose**: Financial transaction tracking

- **Storage**: Client-side user storage using localStorage
- **Integration**: Allows browsing without account, requires login for business features

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI components
2. **Manager Classes**: Specific manager classes handle business logic
3. **Storage Layer**: StorageManager handles all data persistence
4. **UI Updates**: Components update the DOM based on data changes
5. **Offline Support**: Service Worker ensures functionality without internet

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**: Primary typography
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library (referenced in service worker)

### Browser APIs
- **localStorage**: Primary data storage
- **Service Worker API**: Offline functionality
- **Web App Manifest**: PWA installation
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Deployment Strategy

### PWA Deployment
- **Hosting**: Static file hosting (can be served from any web server)
- **Caching Strategy**: Service Worker caches static assets for offline use
- **Installation**: Users can install as native app on mobile/desktop
- **Updates**: Cache versioning system for application updates

### Performance Optimization
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Static assets served from cache
- **Lazy Loading**: Modules loaded as needed
- **Compression**: CSS and JavaScript minification recommended
- **CDN Integration**: External resources loaded from CDN

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Requires ES6 module support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with responsive design

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Client-Side Only?
- **Problem**: Need for simple deployment without server infrastructure
- **Solution**: Complete client-side application with localStorage
- **Benefits**: No server costs, easy deployment, works offline
- **Limitations**: No data synchronization across devices

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
- **Problem**: Need for lightweight, fast-loading application
- **Solution**: ES6 modules without heavy frameworks
- **Benefits**: Smaller bundle size, faster load times, no framework dependencies
- **Trade-offs**: More verbose code, manual DOM manipulation

### Why localStorage?
- **Problem**: Need for persistent data storage without database
- **Solution**: Browser's localStorage API
- **Benefits**: Simple implementation, works offline, no server required
- **Limitations**: Storage size limits, single-device access

### Why PWA Architecture?
- **Problem**: Need for app-like experience across devices
- **Solution**: Progressive Web App with Service Worker
- **Benefits**: Offline functionality, installable, native app feel
- **Requirements**: HTTPS for production deployment
